ArcSpreadWebSummaries
=====================

Web page summaries via text and image collages.  Initial version is by
"Siddhi S. Soman" <ssoman@stanford.edu>.  That version allows users to
create page summaries from text summaries that are based on Jyotika
Prasat's text summarization. Page summaries may also use images from
the page. These images are prioritized by size, placement near
important text, etc.

The project is organized via Maven. Repository is Github:
git@github.com:paepcke/ArcSpreadWebSummaries.git.
